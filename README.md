ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @james-gannon.
ðŸ–§ Iâ€™m interested in Web3 development and security, distributed and edge computing, machine and deep learning, and proof of ownership for non-fungible assets.
ðŸŒ± I spend my time writing code, helping businesses and individuals integrate with the digital asset class, going to the dojo, and getting side tracked.

Artwork, Web3 for autonomous systems, and good books.
